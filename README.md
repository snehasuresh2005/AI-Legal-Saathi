    Access the API Key section:
    Once you're in the AI Studio, look for the "Get API key" or "Get API key in Google AI Studio" button or link. It's usually located on the left-side navigation panel.
    
    
    Create your new key:
    Click on "Create API key" and then "Create API key in new project". This will instantly generate a new, unique API key for you.
    
    Copy and secure your key:
